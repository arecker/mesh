For now, just some notes about trying to make a kubernetes cluster.

Following [[https://gist.github.com/triangletodd/02f595cd4c0dc9aac5f7763ca2264185][this guide]].

Had to do something to enable [[https://superuser.com/questions/1344024/how-do-i-make-bridge-nf-call-iptables-change-persist-across-reboot][this iptables module]], supposedly
persists, but I'm not rebooting this thing.

Generated a new SSH key pair on the kubernetes console.  Just ran
=k3sup install= and let it do its thing.
